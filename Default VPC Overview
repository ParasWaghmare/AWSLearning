Default VPC Overview


The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that is created with your AWS account, known as the default VPC.

All new AWS accounts have a default VPC so that you can start using it right away. New EC2 instances launched into the default VPC, if you do not specify any subnets, will be placed there by default. When you start with your account, you only have one VPC, which is the default VPC.

The default VPC has internet connectivity by default. This is why our instances are able to access the internet immediately. Each EC2 instance within the default VPC receives a public IPv4 address, which enables us to connect to our EC2 instances right away after creation. Additionally, each instance gets both a public and a private IPv4 DNS name.

Let's now go into the AWS Management Console to examine this default VPC. We will navigate to the VPC service. The reason for having a default VPC is to simplify the initial experience for newcomers to the cloud. Without a default VPC, it would be very complicated for new users to start using AWS.

However, it is best practice, especially if you have networking knowledge, to create your own VPCs in production accounts instead of using the default VPC.

On the VPC dashboard, on the left-hand side, you will find your VPCs. Currently, one VPC is created by default. It does not have a custom name but is labeled as the default VPC because it is created automatically. This VPC has an IPv4 CIDR block defined.

Using an IP range calculator, we can determine the range of IP addresses in this CIDR block. The CIDR is a /16, which means the last two octets of the IP address can vary. This results in a total of 65,536 possible IP addresses in that range.

Currently, only one IPv4 CIDR block is associated with the VPC. There are no IPv6 CIDRs, flow logs are not enabled, and there are no tags associated with the VPC.

Exploring the menu options, we see the main route table, main network ACLs, and other components. We will examine these in detail later in the course, one at a time. For now, let's explore the menu.

There are three subnets already created and linked to the default VPC. Each subnet has its own IPv4 CIDR block. On the right-hand side, you can see the availability zones; each subnet is in a different availability zone. This design provides a highly available architecture by default.

For example, examining one subnet, we can calculate its CIDR range. This subnet has a total of 4,096 hosts. However, in the subnets console, the number of available IPv4 addresses is 4,091. We will explore why five IP addresses are reserved later in the course. The available IP count would be lower if the subnet is already in use.

Each subnet has an associated route table and network ACL. The default subnets have the setting "auto-assign public IPv4 address" enabled. This means any EC2 instance created in these subnets will automatically receive a public IPv4 address.

Flow logs are not enabled for the subnets. The route table exists and will be examined shortly. The network ACL allows all traffic on all protocols from everywhere for both inbound and outbound directions. This configuration ensures that any instance launched into these subnets will have network connectivity.

There are no CIDR reservations or tags for the subnets. Now, let's look at the route table. The route table directs traffic within your VPC. The default route table, also called the main route table, has two rules. One of these rules directs all traffic outside of the VPC's CIDR block to the internet gateway.

The internet gateway is attached to the VPC and provides internet access to EC2 instances within the VPC. This explains why our EC2 instances have internet connectivity. We will examine the internet gateway in more detail later in the course.

The route table is not explicitly associated with any subnets but is implicitly associated because the subnets do not have a specific route table assigned. Therefore, the main route table is assigned to them by default.

In summary, we have reviewed VPCs, subnets, route tables, and the internet gateway at a high level. This overview helps explain why we can launch EC2 instances and why they receive specific IP addresses and connectivity. In upcoming sections, we will spend more time examining these components and recreate our own VPC to understand their structure and function in detail.


Key Takeaways

    The default VPC is automatically created in new AWS accounts to simplify initial cloud usage.
    Each EC2 instance launched in the default VPC receives a public IPv4 address and DNS names, enabling immediate internet connectivity.
    The default VPC includes three subnets across different availability zones for high availability.
    The main route table directs outbound traffic to the internet gateway, providing internet access to instances within the VPC.
