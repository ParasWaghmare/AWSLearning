Amazon S3 Overview from a Database Perspective
Summary of Amazon S3 from a Database Perspective

Amazon S3 is a key-value store designed for objects. It excels when storing large objects but is less efficient for many small objects. Being serverless, it offers infinite scaling capabilities. The maximum object size supported is five terabytes, and it supports versioning to track object changes over time.
Storage Tiers and Lifecycle Management

Amazon S3 provides different storage tiers including S3 Standard, Infrequent Access, Intelligent Tiering, and Glacier. Lifecycle policies enable automatic transitions between these tiers based on your data management needs.
Key Features

Important features to be aware of include:

    Versioning
    Encryption
    Replication
    Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) deletes
    Access logs

Security Mechanisms

Security in Amazon S3 is managed through IAM policies, bucket policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and Access Points. Additionally, MFA deletes provide an extra layer of protection against accidental or malicious deletions.
Advanced Features

    S3 Object Lambda allows modification of objects before they are delivered to applications.
    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enables controlled access to resources from different origins.
    Object Lock and Vault Lock for Glacier provide compliance and data retention capabilities.

Encryption Options

Amazon S3 supports various encryption mechanisms:

    SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with S3 Managed Keys)
    SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS keys, including customer-managed keys)
    SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys)
    Client-side encryption
    TLS encryption for data in transit

You can also set a default encryption scheme for your S3 buckets.
Batch Operations and Inventory

S3 Batch Operations enable you to perform large-scale batch actions on objects, such as encrypting unencrypted objects or copying files between buckets before enabling replication. To create lists of objects for these operations, you can use S3 Inventory.
Performance Enhancements

To improve performance, Amazon S3 offers:

    Multi-part upload for parallel file uploads
    Transfer Acceleration to speed up transfers between regions
    S3 Select to retrieve only the data you need from objects

Automation with Event Notifications

Amazon S3 supports event notifications that integrate with SNS, SQS, Lambda, and EventBridge. This allows you to react automatically to events such as new object creation in your buckets.
Use Cases

Amazon S3 is commonly used for storing static files, serving as a key-value store for large files, and hosting websites.

If you have any doubts about these features, especially since they can appear on exams, it is recommended to review the Amazon S3 section in detail.
